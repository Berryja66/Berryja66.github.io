<p>The Triple Crown is considered the greatest accomplishment in motorsport with only one team having earned the prestigious honour: McLaren. They became the first and only team to have won the Monaco GP, the Indy 500 and Le Mans, completing the set in 1995 with a win at the Le Mans 24 hours on their debut.</p>

<p>McLaren became the first team to claim the triple crown with a win at the 24 hours of Le Man in 1995 on their debut. Luck did play a factor in the success of the McLaren F1 GTR though the F1 deserves its fantastic reputation both as a road car and a race car as demonstrated today by the prices of McLaren F1s no matter the guise.</p>
